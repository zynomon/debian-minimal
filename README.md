---
KDE script. 
kde minimal needs 1900 MB or something like that space, you can also just install plasma-desktop using the no recommends tag but the result will be a broken install where some stuff doesn't work, kde desktop environment has few hardcoded options that doesn't checks for if something is available or not it just shows up, 

The script has, 
file manager with file picker, web-browser, default application configurator, screenshot utility kicker menu editor ( .desktop file editor)
